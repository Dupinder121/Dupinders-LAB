Used Bridged networking to show VM with http setup as a separate device on the college LAN, accessed the webpage on <guest ip>:8000 (port 8000), then tried SSH into in (didn’t work) 
I have added GNS3 for now to the previous setup (Project1) , ssh into GNS3 VM, tried to SSH into it using college PC (Windows, standard account, didn’t succeed) 

SSH worked  On host OS terminal, under root account with usage of correct ip and password 
-	ssh gns3@<ip address>  (SYNTAX TO REMEMBER) 
SSH Failed  On host OS, under standard account (Windows) 
SSH Failed  port 22 returned “permission denied”
REASON : 
-	port 22 not open, ssh server not initialized 

SOMETHING NEW I LEARNT : openssh on linux  
-	systemctl ssh.socket 
-	OR sshd.socket 
-	OR openssh 

TO REMEMBER : software differ on pacman & apt as well as service or socket names 

WHAT I LEARNT UNDER VIRTUALIZATION 
-	How to clone VMs completely, cloning and storing it separately 
-	To clone VMs, run different instances, but is stored as single file, just with slightly increased size (due to snapshot data being stored in the same directory) 

Actual term for this: Linked clones (is applicable for VMware/VirtualBox/Cloud VMs; AWS, Azure etc.) 

To work on next, make the Cisco 7000 series switch work virtually 
Cisco switches work on NX-OS (Nexus OS) (proprietary, available under educational license) 

Storing all of this on Github now, learning as I document for revision.
