# Dupinder’s Lab  

This repository is my personal lab notebook - where I record everything I experiment with, learn, break, and fix.  
It’s not meant to be perfectly organized by concept; instead, it follows my journey step by step - day by day, week by week.  

This is where I track progress, failures, successes, and future plans.

## Purpose  

- Capture daily/weekly learning progress  
- Record hands-on experiments with networking, virtualization, Linux, and beyond  
- Keep raw notes as well as polished documentation  
- Serve as a personal archive I can revisit later

## Current Focus Areas  

- **Networking** → web servers, SSH, protocols, VM networking  
- **Virtualization** → VMware, VirtualBox, GNS3, QEMU  
- **Linux** → command-line usage, services, troubleshooting  
- **Security (early steps)** → SSH, HTTPS vs HTTP, basic exposure

## Structure of this Repo  

The structure is simple for a Personal Lab   

- Folders for projects or experiments  
- Rough notes for day-to-day learning   

**Examples:**  
- `Networking Experiments/`  
- `Linux Notes/`  
- `Virtualization Tests/`  
- `Daily Logs/`

## Note  

This repo is personal and raw — like a working diary than a polished documentation   
This is not meant to be used in any way for actual production or as an official source for technical learning
